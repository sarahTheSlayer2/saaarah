yo. if you need notes or want to study music 2gether lmk

Thank you very much but I think it's a tad late for that
What did you all study?

Yes, unfortunately you did not read that until 6 hours after I sent it. 
I looked over my notes from lecture about the main composers and eras and styles. And I listened to all the pieces 
so I can hopefully identify them in the listening section

That's pretty much the same thing I did, quiz was a breeze

you are such a genius. Are you also going to get a 100% on the midterm too? 
I got a an 89% on the cs exam and basically i suck at coding and hate my life. 

Well at least you can basically just not do anything and still pass the class with all the points 
Did you ever figure out what brandon got?
