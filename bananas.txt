yo. if you need notes or want to study music 2gether lmk

Thank you very much but I think it's a tad late for that
What did you all study?

Yes, unfortunately you did not read that until 6 hours after I sent it. 
I looked over my notes from lecture about the main composers and eras and styles. And I listened to all the pieces 
so I can hopefully identify them in the listening section
